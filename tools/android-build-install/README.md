# Android Build and Install

Build Android projects with their Gradle wrappers, keep local repositories current, compare installed APKs with local builds, and run the right build/install/launch steps from one Windows 11 dashboard.

## Requirements

- Windows 11
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Git for Windows for Git status/update features
- an Android project containing `gradlew.bat`
- a JDK compatible with the project's Gradle / Android Gradle Plugin versions
- Android SDK Platform-Tools (`adb.exe`)
- Android SDK Build-Tools (`aapt2.exe` or `aapt.exe`) for package inspection, device comparison, and auto-launch
- an Android device with USB debugging enabled
- the appropriate Windows USB driver when the device requires one

The project remains responsible for its normal Gradle dependencies and Android SDK components.

## Normal workflow

1. Connect and unlock the Android device.
2. Double-click `Build-And-Install-Android.bat`.
3. The dashboard refreshes each saved project and displays its **Git**, **Local Build**, and **Device** state.
4. Select a project and use **Sync & Run** for the normal development loop, or choose an explicit lower-level action when needed.
5. After Build or Sync & Run finishes, the dashboard returns for additional work.

The available actions are:

- **Sync & Run** — safely update Git when needed, rebuild only when the local APK is stale/missing, install only when the device differs, and optionally launch the app;
- **Build** — always run the configured Gradle build, install the selected APK, and optionally launch it;
- **Git Pull** — explicitly run the safe fast-forward-only repository update;
- **Refresh Status** — refresh Git remote state, local APK freshness, and device comparison;
- **Settings...** — configure persistent project-specific defaults including a preferred device;
- **Scan Device...** — show device/APK comparison details for all saved projects;
- **Reports...** — inspect previous build/install logs;
- **Add... / Remove** — manage remembered repository paths.

Double-clicking a project remains equivalent to **Build**. The default action button is **Sync & Run**.

## Project status dashboard

The main project list contains these live status columns:

### Git

Examples include:

- **Current** — local branch matches its upstream;
- **Behind N** — upstream has commits that can potentially be fast-forwarded;
- **Ahead N** — local branch has commits not present upstream;
- **Diverged A/B** — both local and upstream have unique commits;
- **Dirty** — tracked or untracked local changes are present;
- **Detached** / **No upstream** / **Fetch failed** — Git state needs explicit attention.

A full **Refresh Status** performs `git fetch --quiet` to update remote-tracking information. It never merges, resets, checks out, or changes the working tree.

### Local Build

Typical states are:

- **Fresh** — a usable local APK exists and no non-generated project file is newer than it;
- **Stale** — at least one project input is newer than the local APK;
- **No APK** — no local debug APK exists yet;
- **Ambiguous** — multiple APK outputs exist and no deterministic target can be selected;
- **Preferred missing** — the configured preferred APK is not currently present.

Fresh/stale detection is deliberately conservative. Generated/build/cache directories such as `.git`, `.gradle`, `.idea`, `build`, `node_modules`, and `out` are ignored; other project files are treated as potential inputs so asset changes are not missed.

### Device

Examples include:

- **Same** — the installed APK and selected local APK have identical SHA-256 hashes;
- **Different** — the app is installed but its APK bytes differ;
- **Not installed**;
- **No local build**;
- **No device**;
- **Choose device** — multiple authorized devices are attached and no preferred device has been saved;
- **Preferred absent** — the remembered device is not currently connected/authorized;
- **Unknown** — an exact comparison cannot safely be made.

Hovering a status row shows more detailed Git/build/device diagnostics.

## Sync & Run

**Sync & Run** is the optimized one-click path. It performs these checks/actions in order:

1. refresh Git remote-tracking state and validate the repository;
2. validate that the target Android device is connected before doing an expensive build;
3. when the clean branch is behind its upstream, update it with `git pull --ff-only`;
4. inspect the local APK;
5. rebuild only when the APK is missing or stale;
6. compare the resulting local APK with the installed APK;
7. skip installation when the SHA-256 hashes already match;
8. otherwise install with `adb install -r`;
9. launch the app when auto-launch is enabled.

Examples of valid optimized paths include:

```text
Current Git -> Fresh APK -> Same on device -> Launch only
```

```text
Behind upstream -> Fast-forward pull -> Stale APK -> Build -> Install -> Launch
```

```text
Current Git -> Fresh APK -> Not installed -> Install -> Launch
```

Sync & Run stops rather than guessing when safety or targeting is ambiguous. In particular it stops on dirty/diverged Git state, unavailable remembered devices, or ambiguous APK selection. The explicit **Build**, **Git Pull**, and **Settings...** actions remain available for handling those cases deliberately.

Projects that are not Git repositories can still use Sync & Run; the Git update stage is simply skipped.

## Drag and drop

Drag an Android repository or project folder onto `Build-And-Install-Android.bat` in File Explorer.

The dragged path is used immediately, remembered for future sessions, and **Build** is run using saved per-project settings. After the run finishes, the dashboard opens.

Both root-level and nested Android layouts are supported. For example:

```text
chatturanga/
    gradlew.bat
```

and:

```text
prism-break/
    android/
        gradlew.bat
```

The tool searches for `gradlew.bat` in the selected directory and up to two directory levels below it. If multiple Gradle roots exist, explicit Build may ask which one to use; Sync & Run treats an ambiguous project layout as a condition requiring attention.

## Saved projects

Remembered repository paths are stored per Windows user at:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\WindowsTools\android-build-install\projects.json
```

The most recently used project moves to the top. Paths that no longer exist are omitted from the dashboard. Removing a project from the dashboard does not modify or delete the repository.

## Per-project settings

Click **Settings...** for the selected project. Settings are stored outside Git at:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\WindowsTools\android-build-install\project-preferences.json
```

Existing preference files are backward compatible; newly added fields simply use their normal defaults until configured.

### Gradle task

Default:

```text
assembleDebug
```

This can be changed for projects that use another assemble task, for example:

```text
assembleDemoDebug
```

### Preferred APK

When a project produces several debug APKs, a preferred APK can be stored so Build, Scan Device, dashboard status, and Sync & Run all use the same deterministic target.

The path can be absolute or relative to the saved repository path. A relative path is recommended because it remains valid if the entire repository tree is moved together.

For Prism Break, the conventional preferred APK is:

```text
android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

If a configured preferred APK is missing, the dashboard reports **Preferred missing**. Explicit Build may fall back to its APK chooser; Sync & Run stops and asks for the preference/layout to be corrected rather than guessing.

### JAVA_HOME

A project-specific JDK directory can be selected. When configured, the tool sets `JAVA_HOME` for that build before invoking the project's Gradle wrapper.

When blank, Java resolution follows the normal environment:

1. existing `JAVA_HOME`;
2. `java.exe` on `PATH`.

### Preferred device

A project can remember one ADB device serial. Click **Detect...** in Settings to list currently connected/authorized devices and choose one; the serial is stored with that project's preferences.

This is especially useful when more than one phone/tablet/emulator is attached. Build, dashboard status, Scan Device, and Sync & Run then target the remembered device instead of prompting or guessing.

Leave the field blank to retain automatic behavior when only one authorized device is attached.

### Auto-launch

When enabled, a successful install is followed by an attempt to launch the installed package's launcher activity through ADB. Sync & Run also uses this preference when it determines that installation can be skipped: an already-current app can be launched without rebuilding or reinstalling it.

The APK package ID is read with Android Build-Tools. Auto-launch failure is treated as a warning after a successful installation.

## Git Pull

Select a project and click **Git Pull** to update its repository explicitly.

The action deliberately uses:

```text
git pull --ff-only
```

and has conservative safety rules:

- the selected path must be inside a Git repository;
- the current branch must have an upstream tracking branch;
- detached HEAD is rejected;
- any tracked or untracked working-tree change causes the pull to stop;
- no automatic stash, merge commit, reset, checkout, or conflict resolution is performed;
- non-fast-forward pulls fail without changing history.

Sync & Run uses the same update helper when its status preflight determines that a clean project is behind its upstream.

## Build and install behavior

The default build command is:

```text
gradlew.bat assembleDebug --stacktrace
```

After a successful build the tool searches Android module output directories under:

```text
build\outputs\apk
```

If there is one debug APK it is selected automatically. When several exist, the saved preferred APK is used if it exactly matches a produced APK; otherwise explicit Build asks which one to install.

Installation uses:

```text
adb -s <device-serial> install -r <apk>
```

`-r` replaces an existing installation while preserving app data when Android permits the update.

The internal build/install runner also supports separate build-only, install-only, and launch-only stages. Sync & Run uses those stages to avoid redundant work; normal **Build** retains the familiar full build/install behavior.

The tool does **not** automatically uninstall an app when Android reports `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`. Uninstalling normally removes local app data, so that remains an explicit user action.

## Device scan

Click **Scan Device...** to compare existing local debug APKs with packages currently installed on the appropriate attached device. The scan does not rebuild or install anything.

Results include **Same**, **Different**, **Not installed**, **No local build**, and **Unknown**. The scanner identifies package IDs using Android Build-Tools, queries the installed package with ADB, temporarily pulls a single installed APK when possible, computes SHA-256 hashes, and removes the temporary copy afterward.

Split APK installations and other cases where byte-for-byte comparison is not reliable are reported as **Unknown** rather than guessed.

## Reports and failure logs

Each build/install stage is recorded under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\WindowsTools\android-build-install\logs
```

Reports include:

- selected project;
- Gradle task;
- preferred APK preference;
- JDK override;
- preferred/explicit device serial;
- auto-launch setting;
- whether build/install stages were skipped;
- Gradle output when a build ran;
- ADB install/launch output when those stages ran;
- final exit code.

Use **Reports...** to browse and open previous runs. If a build/install stage fails, its report also opens automatically in Notepad.

## Finding ADB

The tool does not require `adb` to be on `PATH`. It checks, in order:

1. `sdk.dir` in the selected Gradle project's `local.properties`;
2. `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`;
3. `ANDROID_HOME`;
4. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk`;
5. `adb.exe` on `PATH`.

## Device handling

- A remembered preferred device is used when configured and available.
- With no preference and one authorized device, that device is selected automatically.
- With no preference and multiple authorized devices, explicit Build can ask which target to use; dashboard status reports **Choose device**, and Sync & Run asks you to save a preferred device first.
- An unauthorized/offline/missing preferred device causes a clear stop rather than silently selecting another device.

## Command-line use

The compatibility entrypoint remains:

```powershell
.\Build-And-Install-Android.ps1 -Project "C:\src\chatturanga"
```

Optional arguments include:

```powershell
.\Build-And-Install-Android.ps1 `
    -Project "C:\src\some-app" `
    -GradleTask "assembleDemoDebug" `
    -PreferredApk "app\build\outputs\apk\demo\debug\app-demo-debug.apk" `
    -JavaHome "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr" `
    -DeviceSerial "DEVICE_SERIAL" `
    -AutoLaunch
```

Direct command-line calls do not use the saved-project dashboard or persistent per-project preferences unless those values are explicitly supplied.

## Safety characteristics

- project source remains untouched by build/install operations;
- each project uses its own Gradle wrapper;
- Sync & Run never stashes, resets, discards, checks out, or auto-merges Git work;
- Git remote refresh uses fetch only; repository updating uses `git pull --ff-only` only when status is safe;
- installation never starts when a required Gradle build fails;
- the tool never automatically uninstalls an Android application;
- `adb install -r` is used to preserve app data where Android permits it;
- APK/device comparison is read-only except for a temporary local copy that is removed afterward;
- ambiguous APK/device/Git states are surfaced rather than guessed;
- saved projects and preferences live under the Windows user's local application-data directory, outside Git repositories;
- build/install diagnostics are preserved as timestamped reports.

## Developer validation

Run the lightweight integration check from this directory with Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Test-AndroidBuildInstall.ps1
```

It uses an isolated temporary project and state directory; no Android device,
real JDK, Gradle download, or additional test framework is required. The check
covers PowerShell parsing, a configured `JAVA_HOME`, paths containing spaces, a
successful up-to-date build becoming fresh, scanner parameter binding, and a
non-destructive expected failure path.

## Possible future improvements

- optional test/lint tasks in Sync & Run before installation;
- configurable status refresh behavior for very large repositories;
- richer Android App Bundle / split-install workflows;
- optional per-project launch activity override for apps without a conventional launcher activity.
